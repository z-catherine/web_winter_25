    <p class = "paragraph">
        The language of flowers is a poem written in petals and colors, branches and thorns. It is used to share messages silently, every flower possessing it's own unique meaning. Each blossom carries a hidden message, a whisper of emotion that reaches across time and space, connecting hearts in ways words cannot. I chose this topic because flowers have always felt magical to me. Something so simple can hold such deep meaning, connecting people through natureâ€™s quiet poetry. A language that transcends the written and spoken language and connects us to each other and the world around us.
