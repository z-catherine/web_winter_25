    <p>i have been described as a force of nature — driven, relentless, and curious. i balance academics with a deep love for the arts, finding beauty in both structure and creativity. i love academics not for its rigidity but for its infinite possibilities, its loopholes, hidden tricks, and elegant logic and thinking that transforms numbers into something almost magical. yet, at my core, i am an artist and a dreamer.</p>

    <p>i find solace in cello, ballet, and the quiet beauty of ghibli films and nature. in these spaces, i am reminded that precision and grace are not opposites but two sides of the same coin. beyond myself, environmental issues interest me, not as abstract problems but as challenges that demand both understanding and action. whether in academics, the arts, or the future i envision, i seek more than just success — i seek meaning, creation, and the pursuit of something greater than myself. i do not follow a path; i carve one, with precision and curiosity. there is always more to learn, more to create, more to understand. my intensity is not about proving something, but about exploring, questioning, and refining both myself and the world around me.</p>

    <p>my mind, doesn’t just seek answers—it seeks to understand the underlying truths, the threads that tie everything together. i don’t just observe the world; i question it, uncovering the hidden layers beneath its surface. when i grow up, i want to be remembered, leave a lasting mark on the world.</p>
