    <p class = "paragraph">i enjoy web class because it allows me to express my creativity in a stem - based context. working with css, js, and html gives me the opportunity to create something functional yet also visually appealing. the process of designing and coding websites feels like a mix of art and technology, which is combines my interests. and especially with js, making a something work smoothly is incredibly rewarding.</p>

    <p class = "paragraph">i like math because its a form of organized chaos, where everything has an underlying structure, yet it still is so complex and infinite. i enjoy discovering tricks and loopholes that make problems easier to solve or reveal hidden shortcuts. the sense of exploration and creativity that math entails, its balance between order and unpredictability is one reason i enjoy it so much.</p>

    <div class = "button">
    <button onclick = "pFunOne()">my favourite class is...</button>

    </div>

    <p class = "paragraph">i like science because it lets me explore the world around me and understand how everything works at its core, how in science, every discovery opens up more questions and possibilities. ive always been a curious person, which is why i like science, how it explains things. i enjoy the process of experimenting, recording data, writing lab write ups, designing labs, and everything in between, the way it combines observation, logic, and creativity</p>
